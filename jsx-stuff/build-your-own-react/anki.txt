- How is an element represented in a fibre tree? An element is represented as a fiber in a fiber tree. Additionally, each fiber is a unit of work

- In a react element POJO, what are the possible values for the `type` attribute?
  - string - DOM Node
  - function - Functional Component / Class
- What does a element tree contain? DOM Nodes & element
- What does each component & instances have? It's own state and properties

- What happens when two root elements are different? The previous tree and it's children will be destroyed in favour of the new one
